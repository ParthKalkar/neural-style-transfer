This repository contains the code for implementation of the Neural Style Transfer Algorithm. 

## Art in Deep Learning: Neural Style Transfer

In this notebook, we will learn about Neural Style Transfer. This algorithm was created by Gatys et al. (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). 

**In this notebook, we will:**
- Implement the neural style transfer algorithm 
- Generate novel artistic images using our algorithm 

Most of the algorithms you've studied optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. In Neural Style Transfer, you'll optimize a cost function to get pixel values!
